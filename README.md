# Live on Mars
Live on Mars is a simple website designed to inspire those who wish to leave this earth and live on mars. The site includes information about the Live on Mars space program, with clear objectives and launch dates. For those who wish to come on the mission, there is a sign up form. The site also includes contact details and a gallery with images of previous missions.

# Features



* **Header & Navigation**

    - At the top of the page, you'll find the website logo/name in the header. The entire width of the header has been made a navigation link to the home page for simplicity. 
    - The 3 navigation links are placed within the section below, and appear to be floating in space, focussing attention to the theme related hero image. When hovered over they will display a full white border for futuristic styling.
    - When clicked, the nav links will take the user to the relevant part of the page. The gallery link directs the user to a seperate gallery page. 
    - The nav links are not visible on the gallery page, instead the user simply clicks the header bar to direct them back home.

* **Landing page image & cover text**

    - The landing page image combines an epic picture taken from space with an exciting text overlay that draws in the user and hints to scroll down for more information about the website.
    - Similar to the navigation links, the cover text appears to be floating in space, purposefully without any borders or background.
